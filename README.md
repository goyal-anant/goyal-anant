I'm a PhD student focused on advanced numerical electromagnetics, EM simulation tools, and wave–material interaction. Experienced in building and validating high-fidelity 2D/3D EM models for complex structures, with strong expertise in optimization workflows, numerical solvers, simulation–experiment correlation, and scientific writing.
